Sources and Citations
=====================

The Sources and Citations Exploratory Group (or S&CEG) is tasked with
carrying out exploratory work into the data representation of
information about and information contained within individual documents,
monuments, artefacts, interviews, and other sources of data of interest
to family history.  Contributions from both experts and the wider genealogical 
community are welcome and necessary for the work.
