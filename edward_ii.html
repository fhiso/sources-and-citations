    <h1>Edward II</h1>
 
    <p>
      Edward II was the fourth son of Edward I and his first wife, 
      Eleanor of Castile.<a id="fnref1" class="fnref" href="#fn1">1</a>
      He was born in Caernarfon Castle in North Wales on 
      25 April 1284, less than a year after Edward I had conquered 
      the region, and as a result is sometimes called Edward of
      Caernarfon.<a id="fnref2" class="fnref" href="#fn2">2</a>
      His father was the King of England, and had also inherited 
      Gascony in south-western France, which he held as the
      feudal vassal of the King of France, and the Lordship 
      of Ireland.<a id="fnref3" class="fnref" href="#fn3">3</a>
