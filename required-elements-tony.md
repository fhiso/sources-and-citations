I just want to take an informal tour of the source types mentioned previously \[in email\]
to look at their main citation elements. These are simply some of the more common ones
I've used in citations on my blog, but I want to capture some of the edge-cases and
and mention any special considerations for real usage.

# Books
Still need to indicate creator types somehow, e.g. author,
compiler, editor, illustrator, indexer, transcriber, translator.

# Newspapers
We also have authors, article titles (analogous to chapter), and paper name
(analogous to published book). The publication date
is the issue date, and so would involve a day (in addition to month/year).
More than with published books, newspaper editions may precede the
Julian-to-Gregorian changeover. I think this will force us to leave room for
a calendar indication in the general form of dates, even if it's only this
pair of alternatives for now. Obviously, it would be daft to not leave some
evolutionary path open, though. The where-in information has some
similarities with books: page(s), column(s) (essential for broadsheets).

# Web sites
EE uses a close analogy between these and books so that the general form is:

> Author/Creator, *Title of Book/Website* (Place of publication = URL : Date), specific-item

Specific article or page on Web site -- again, the analogy includes this, in
addition to online databases, images, and database-with-images -- I have
discussed the differences between these with ESM as she considers a
"database" to only contain text extracts. Although applications that put
images directly into a database are rare, databases are still common an the
essential index in locating image resources. The database name is analogous
to a book chapter, and the Web site as the published book title.

> Creator of Page/Database/Chapter, "Title of Page/Database/Chapter",
> Website creator or book editor, *Title of Website/Book* (Place of
> publication = URL : Date of creation or access), specific-item

The site creator may be dropped if it's obvious, e.g. Ancestry, as it would
introduce duplication. The specific item (what I call "where-in" elsewhere)
can get quite complicated if you're citing an entry in a database. I don't
know whether we should bother itemising this group of data, or just have a
single generic element for it.

It's common to indicate the type of what you're looking at (e.g. image,
database, PDF attachment, etc), and when there are layers -- such as when
the image of an original record is hosted on the site --  then there are
some joining words used (see
<https://www.evidenceexplained.com/content/questions-about-linking-layers-and-item-types>).
We obviously need to indicate the type of the online item, but I'm unclear
whether the joining words between layers affects anything in our plans.

Titles often have a long and a short form, with the shorter form being used
on subsequent citations (see
<https://www.evidenceexplained.com/quicktips/citing-full-titles-vs-short-titles>).
It strikes me that something similar to our multiple name forms can be
employed here.

<https://www.evidenceexplained.com/quicktips/citing-online-sources-whats-essential>
for a summary of online-source citations.

The database may not have a specific name (see
<https://www.facebook.com/evidenceexplained/posts/1587815591293817>) in which
case a description has to be used (appearing not in quotes, and so must be 
distinct).

# Emails and social media
The analogy covers this too (see
<https://www.evidenceexplained.com/quicktips/citing-facebook-revisited>), but
there is a problem with citing the timestamp of a post or a comment.
ESM may not have considered the issue of time zones, and we
briefly discussed this at
<https://www.facebook.com/evidenceexplained/posts/1587815591293817>.
Basically, if a time is specified then it must either be UTC (a bit
difficult for most users) or the author's local time zone must be stated, in
which case the software can convert to UTC. ESM
suggested that the corresponding post/comment can be inferred, but then that
would mean the timestamp is unnecessary as well as meaningless.

# Blogs
> Authors, "title", blog host/creator, *name of blog*, posted-date
> (URL : accessed-date), specific-item

# Original documents
It is common for a work to not have an explicit
creator or date, and the abbreviation "n.d." indicates "no date". However, I
have instances where these elements can be inferred, even though they are
not explicit in the consulted source. In print, they would be enclosed in
editorial brackets to indicate the difference, but I don't know if a
citation element can represent this status.

There are standards for archival hierarchies, but not everyone uses them. If
we have elements to hold the archival code at each level (fonds down to
item) then we might still need a generic one. We should probably include
elements for the internal (sub-item) levels, too, such as folios and pages.

# Parish registers
Again, the date may be a Julian one, although when
they've been consulted in a database then that may not be obvious. Should we
have a way of stating the ambiguity? See Table-1 at
