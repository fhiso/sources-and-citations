DIRECTIVES of the SOURCES AND CITATIONS EXPLORATORY GROUP
of the FAMILY HISTORY INFORMATION STANDARDS ORGANISATION, INC.


1.  Mission
===========

The Sources and Citations Exploratory Group (S&CEG) of the Family History
Information Standards Organisation, Inc. (FHISO) is tasked with carrying
out exploratory work, as defined in section 1.2 of the Technical
Standing Committee (TSC) Operations and Policy Manual (O&PM), into the 
data representation of information about and information contained within 
individual documents, monuments, artefacts, interviews, and other sources
of data of interest to family history.

The S&CEG shall research, compare and document the approach to sources and 
citations adopted by current applications and standards in wide-spread
use.  The S&CEG may include other such applications, standards and
research in this work as they see fit.  The TSC may also direct the S&CEG
to consider any relevant ideas submitted to the TSC as part of its Call
for Paper Submissions (CFPS).  A list of such CFPSs is appended to these
Directives as annex A.2.

The S&CEG shall draw on this research to reach a consensus on the broad
manner in which sources and citations are to be modelled in a future FHISO
standard.  Consideration shall be given to compatibility with existing
citation formats and the likely requirements for forwards compatibility.
Areas requiring further research shall be identified, as should potential 
points of extensibility.  Particular attention should be paid to those 
decisions likely to effect the work of other technical groups.

Not everything that may be considered part of a source or citation is
within the scope of the S&CEG.  In particular, the following subjects are
considered beyond of scope of the S&CEG: dates and calendars, personal names,
place names and other geographical data, cross-document information,
documentation of inference and reasoning, human-targeted formatting of 
citation text, formats for integrating citations into existing data formats, 
support for hypothetical future use-cases, and metadata outside the usual
scope of genealogical interest.

The S&CEG shall avoid placing onerous requirements on the choice of
serialisation formats or data formalisms that may be adopted by the
FHISO.


2. Operation
============

The S&CEG shall ordinarily conduct its business on the public
sources-citations@fhiso.org mailing list.  The S&CEG may after consultation
with the TSC conduct business or hold meetings in other manners,
providing it is consistent with principles of the standards development
process given in section 6 of the O&PM.

Work may be prioritised and divided as the S&CEG sees fit.  When a major
section of work is completed, the S&CEG are encouraged to publish it as a
Technical Group Note (TGN) to provide third parties and other FHISO groups
with an indication of the future direction of FHISO's work. 

It is anticipated that the final deliverable produced by the group will
be a formal Project Proposal (per section 4.1 of the O&PM) covering the
content of a future FHISO standard relating to the concepts with in
scope of the S&CEG.  As FHISO's policy with respect to modularisation
develops, the TSC may direct the S&CEG to split this Project Proposal
into several parts, or to liaise with other Exploratory Groups to
produce a single Project Proposal jointly.  The S&CEG may publish their
recommendation as a Working Group Note once it is complete if they feel
it would be premature to formal propose the creation of a Project Team.

The S&CEG may additionally produce any other deliverable permitted by
section 3.3 of the O&PM, and it may produce CFPS Responses for any CFPS
assigned to it per section 3 of the TSC Charter.

All deliverables produced by the S&CEG shall comply with the policies
given in section 5 of the O&PM, and which any style guides that in the
future be approved by the TSC or by FHISO's Executive Committee.  The
TSC shall maintain as annex A.3 to these Directives a record of all
deliverables produce by the S&CEG.

The S&CEG Coordinator shall keep concise minutes of the decision made by
the S&CEG, and other events deemed worthy of record.  The S&CEG
Coordinator should liaise with the TSC to ensure these are made public
no more than a month after the events being minuted.  This task may be
delegated to a Recorder appointed by the S&CEG Coordinator.


3. Governance
=============

The work of the S&CEG shall be supervised by the TSC and is governed by
the policies given in sections 2 and 3 of the O&PM, and section 4 of the
TSC Charter.  The TSC shall appoint an Coordinator for the S&CEG, and who
shall be identified in annex A.1 of these Directives.

The TSC shall maintain as annex A.1 of these Directives a list of
members of the S&CEG, which shall distinguish associate and transitional
members.  The TSC shall inform the S&CEG Coordinator of changes to this
list.  The S&CEG Coordinator is responsible for informing the TSC if in
the S&CEG Coordinators opinion a member lapses into or reverts from
transitional status.  If other formal roles are established in the S&CEG,
these shall be communicated to the TSC and identified in annex A.1.

All members of the S&CEG must abide by FHISO's Code of Conduct.
