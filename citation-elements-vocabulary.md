# A citation elements vocabulary

{.ednote} This is an **exploratory draft** of material intended to form
part of a FHISO Citation Elements standard.  This document is not
endorsed by the FHISO membership, and may be updated, replaced or
obsoleted by other documents at any time. 

## `creatorName` and sub-elements

------           -----------------------------------------------
Name             `http://terms.fhiso.org/sources/creatorName`     
Range            `http://terms.fhiso.org/sources/AgentName`
Cardinality      multi-valued
Translatability  translatable
Super-element    *none*
------           -----------------------------------------------

In the definition of this element and its *sub-elements*, the word
**agent** is used to mean a person, organisation, or other entity
capable of independent or autonomous action.

{.note} An "other entity capable of independent or autonomous action" 
might include sufficiently sophisticated software, such as computer
translation software.

{.note} This definition of an *agent* is aligned to the `Agent` class in
[[FOAF](http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/)].

The `creatorName` element contains name of an agent who created or
contributed to the creation of the *source*.  Many *sub-elements* are
provided for many specific types of creator, and where appropriate these
are preferred to the `creatorName` *super-element*.

{.note} Many of the following *sub-elements* have similar or even
overlapping meanings, and there may be several plausible choices to
describe a particular creator.  Where possible, the description the
creators used to describe themselves should be followed.

### Sub-elements of `creatorName`

`http://terms.fhiso.org/sources/abstratorName`
:   The `abstractorName` element contains the name of an *agent*
    responsible or jointly responsible for creating abstract of another
    *source* &mdash; a shortened versioned containing all the important
    detail.

`http://terms.fhiso.org/sources/artistName`
:   The `abstractorName` element contains the name of an *agent*
    responsible or jointly responsible for 

`http://terms.fhiso.org/sources/authorName`
:   The `authorName` element contains the name of an *agent* responsible
    or jointly responsible for creating a significant portion of
    original content in a written *source*.  

{.note} The `authorName` element should also be used to describe the creator
of a written *source*

`http://terms.fhiso.org/sources/compilerName`
:   The `compilerName` element contains the name of an *agent*
    responsible or jointly responsible for creating a *source* by
    compiling content from many other *sources*.

`http://terms.fhiso.org/sources/composerName`
:   The `composerName` element contains the name of an *agent*
    responsible or jointly responsible for creating a *source* which is
    a piece of music.

{.note} The `composerName` element has been included largely for
compatibility with
[[CSL](//docs.citationstyles.org/en/stable/specification.html)] and
other vocabularies that have such a role.  It is not anticipated that it
will be used much.

`http://terms.fhiso.org/sources/directorName`
:   The `directorName` element contains the name of an *agent*
    responsible for directing the production of a film or other audio
    or visual *source*.

`http://terms.fhiso.org/sources/editorName`
:   The `editorName` element contains the name of an *agent* responsible
    or jointly responsible for selecting, preparing or editing the
    content of a *source*.

`http://terms.fhiso.org/sources/editorTranslatorName`
:   The `editorTranslatorName` element contains the name of an *agent* 
    reponsible or jointly reponsible for the translation of a *source*
    from another language or languages, and who was also had a major
    role in selecting or preparing the choice of material for
    translation.

{.note} The `editorTranslatorName` element has been included largely for
compatibility with
[[CSL](//docs.citationstyles.org/en/stable/specification.html)].  It
combines the roles of the `editorName` and `translatorName` elements,
and should only be used when the editorial aspect is significant.
Usually the `translatorName` element is more appropriate.

`http://terms.fhiso.org/sources/editorialDirectorName`
:   The `editorialDirectorName` element contains the name of an *agent*
    responsible or jointly responsible for the overall vision and
    editorial policies applied across a large number of a publisher's
    publications.

{.note}  The `editorialDirectorName` element has been included 
solely for compatibility with
[[CSL](//docs.citationstyles.org/en/stable/specification.html)].  Few if any
style guides include it.

`http://terms.fhiso.org/sources/illustratorName`
:   The `illustratorName` element contains the name of an *agent*
    responsible or jointly responsible for illustrating a written or
    visual *source*.

`http://terms.fhiso.org/sources/indexerName`
:   The `indexerName` element contains the name of an *agent*
    responsible or jointly responsible for creating a *source* which is
    primarily an index of one or more other *sources*.

`http://terms.fhios.org/sources/intervieweeName`
:   The `intervieweeName` element contains the name of a person who is
    a subject of an interview, and where the *source* is a transcript,
    recording or other representation of that interview.

`http://terms.fhiso.org/sources/interviewerName`
:   The `interviewerName` element contains the name of an agent responsible
    or jointly responsible for asking questions during an interview, and
    where the *source* is a transcript, recording or other representation
    of that interview.  A *citation element set* containing an
    `interviewerName` *should* normally also contain one or more
    `intervieweeName` *citation elements* identifying who was being
    interviewed.

`http://terms.fhiso.org/sources/transcriberName`
:   The `transcriberName` element contains the name of an *agent*
    responsible or jointly responsible for creating a written *source*
    which is primarily a verbatim or near-verbatim transcription of one
    or a small number other *sources*.

{.ednote} This definition needs to be clearer on the distinction between
compilation and transcription.

`http://terms.fhiso.org/sources/translatorName`
:   The `translatorName` element contains the name of an *agent*
    reponsible or jointly reponsible for the translation of a *source*
    from another language or languages.
    
{.ednote ...}  This list of sub-elements is somewhat based on the list
of roles in
[[CSL](//docs.citationstyles.org/en/stable/specification.html)].  No
decision has yet been taken on whether complete harmonisation is
desirable.

CSL's `collection-editor` and `container-author` have been omitted
pending a decision on how to deal with more general matters with
containment.

CSL's `original-author` and `reviewed-author` have been omitted, as it
is FHISO's current intention to store translations and reviews using
layers.

No use cases have been found to warrant the inclusion of CSL's
`editorial-director`.  Applications converting it to FHISO *citation
elements* should treat it as `editor` or `collection-editor`, or drop
it.
